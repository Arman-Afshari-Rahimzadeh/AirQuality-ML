# 🌍 Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project investigates the impact of multiple environmental factors—including **temperature, population density, and pollutant concentrations**—on air quality using **machine learning techniques**.  

Using a **comprehensive open-source dataset**, the project classifies air quality into four levels:  
✅ **Good**  
⚠ **Moderate**  
❌ **Poor**  
☣ **Hazardous**  

Advanced **data analysis techniques** and **visualizations** uncover complex relationships between **particulate matter (PM), gaseous pollutants, temperature, humidity, and demographic features**.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔ Identify key factors affecting **air pollution levels**.  
✔ Apply and compare **multiple classification models** for air quality prediction.  
✔ Find the **best-performing algorithm** for accurate classification.  
✔ Provide **insights for policymakers** to take actionable steps in reducing pollution.
